# CHIMP

## About

Welcome to the Chimp programming language. This is a language that extends Thorsten Ball's Monkey programming language, which is described in *Writing An Interpreter In Go* and *Writing A Compiler In Go*. If you wish to learn more about Monkey or its accompanying books, please visit [https://monkeylang.org](https://monkeylang.org).

The Chimp language is being written for the sole purpose of teaching myself how to write and implement various language features, in the hopes of building my own programming language called Toolip.
